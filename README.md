# Rhenus-Angular CRUD Application
This code is a small Angular (2+) application to manage people.
A person has the following attributes: ID, first name, last name, email address.
The End-user is able to create a person, list all people by name, view details about a person, edit a person, and delete a person from the list.
There is a mock/fake backend service, implemented using JSON-SERVER, to provide requests/responses in JSON format.
